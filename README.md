# VisionARV_Image_classification_using_knowledge_distillation
This project enhances blurry images in real-time using a lightweight deep learning model trained via knowledge distillation. It achieves high visual quality (SSIM ≥ 90%) and 30–60 FPS, making it suitable for video conferencing, surveillance, and edge device deployment.
